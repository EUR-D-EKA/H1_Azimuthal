Getting started on H1.

Login:
-------
Put the following in .zshrc or similar source file

#!/bin/zsh
desygroupset h1
source ${H1_ROOT}/etc/functions.sh
h1lcg

Storage:
--------
(1) home-directory:
 /afs/desy.de/user/U/USERNAME
 where U -> first letter of USERNAME
 and USERNAME -> login name
 check storage:
  fs lq $HOME -human
 Typical quota: 16GB
 daily backup

2) dust space
 /nfs/dust/h1/group
 Total quuta is about 10 TByte for the whole H1 group
 Before using it, create a subdirectory:
   mkdir /nfs/dust/h1/group/$USER
 this is a raid system, without backup
 The main purpose is to store root files and similar for the analysis


Analysis:
---------
Example analysis directory
/nfs/dust/h1/group/ztudesy/h1_analysis/H1_Azimuthal

1) Copy the entire directory 
or folk the analysis Github and git clone the dir on NFS. 
(Version control is important for such complicated analysis)
https://github.com/KongTu/H1_Azimuthal

2) go to H1_Azimuthal/src and compile code
make bin
* the C++ source file is under src, AzimuthalAnalyzer.C. This is the code to be worked on.
* elecCut.C is a code for selecting good electron
* TDetectQedc.C is to select QED Compton event (no need to worry for now)

3) go to H1_Azimuthal/run and run
../bin/x86_64-centos7-gcc9-opt/AzimuthalAnalyzer -f ../input/highE_07_test_data.steer
the output is a tree, which is the input to the miniTree that i generated. 

4) inputs steering file under H1_Azimuthal/input
* Take a look at data steer and MC steer. Same structure, and the directory tells you where to find data. 
* oolumi.steer is a steering file to generate luminosity and good run numbers. To run it, go to H1_Azimuthal/run and do:
oolumi -f ../input/oolumi.steer 
where the output SelectedRuns.root can be used in your analysis code to only apply runs you select.

5)* condor job (producing large statistics sample)
* so my old setup is a batch system not the HT Condor, and with the system upgrade, it doesn't work out of the box. 
HT Condor is much better and advanced. Learn how to setup from,
https://confluence.desy.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=67639562

* There is also an example from the example code for jet analysis see link in 4) below.


Suggested next steps:
---------------------
1) Familiar with the entire framework, understand the structure of the code
   Also, get rid of things you don't need, simply the code.

2) Write a macro of making miniTree, use AzimuthalAnalyzer.root as input. 
   in this macro, apply all event and track selections, save what you need for your offline analysis. 

3) Use your own macro to reproduce the results you have

3.5) at this point, try to setup HTCondor and run the full 06-07 statistics sample

4) Now ready for high Q2 analysis. A few things to learn from highQ2 ANALYSIS code is:
   (https://stash.desy.de/projects/H1ANA/repos/eventshapesmpim/browse)

   * trigger selection s67
   * high Q2 selections. 
   * ...

   * learn how they setup HTCondor with your Executable
   * learn how to select basic events (look at Daniel's email.)



Useful information:
-------------------
https://www-h1.desy.de/
*h1 website has almost everything you need
* any internal site, you need this login: 
(login as h1intweb / FF98kals )

Documentation of H1 classes:
https://www-h1.desy.de/icas/oop/roothtml/4.0.25/ClassIndex.html
* this is the documentation of all H1 classes. This is where you find what function to use, how to get information from the data, etc...
For example, H1PartSelTrack, is to access the selected track (with some quality cuts already). 
https://www-h1.desy.de/icas/oop/roothtml/4.0.25/H1PartSelTrack.html
You can see how you get pt, eta, and other information

Publications Theses are good resources to look at previous work.
* Usually when there is something you don't know, look up something from here.
* including physics, techniques, etc...

H1 DATA
For example,
https://www-h1.desy.de/icas/data/DST/HERA2.html
Summary of all data lists for HERA2 (99-2007) 

H1 MC 
find MC tool:
https://www-h1.desy.de/imc/findmc.html
You can find the necessary info for particular MC. 
Just an example, If you select djangoh14, OO, 2006_e+
the last one, with genID 6018, ReqID 8926, is the djangoh file you have used in your analysis. All info you would need is there. Very powerful tool.

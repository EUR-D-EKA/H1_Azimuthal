1. lumi using their steering file or use .root
2. trigger prescale?
	//924 spacalSubtrigger.insert(67);
	?? analysisbase.c line 234 commented out, no prescale?
3. scattter electron cut
	1046 delete spacal, use LAr
	find how they select electron
	already did electron cut in dobasicCutRec() in AnalysisBase.C line 440


GetKineRecMethod()

// --- systematic shifts for uncertainties
   SetSysShift(fSys);      ???

in FidVolCut.h line 43:
ClassDef(FidVolCut, 1) // Cut class containing cuts on more 
                               // complicated variables (non-generic access)

in FidVolCut.C line 18:
ClassImp(FidVolCut)

why fRunType>0 in steer?

H1Cut* SubTrig67 = new H1CutBool(Trig_L1ac_idx, 67);
AddRecCut(new H1CutOr(new H1CutBool(Event_IsMC), SubTrig67), "SubTrigger S67");

could not open FidVolCut.steer

anaysisbase.C line 363 need to set it?
//Default is non-radiaive MC
